Flickr's ID generation strategy is based on creating **unique identifiers** that are both **globally unique** and **time-ordered**. The method uses a **64-bit** integer, which allows for a huge number of unique IDs that can be generated without collision.

Flickr's strategy involves:

1. **Timestamp-based prefix**: The first part of the ID is a timestamp, which is used to ensure that the IDs are unique and ordered over time. The timestamp is typically expressed in milliseconds or seconds.
   
2. **Sharding/Node identifier**: A part of the ID is used to uniquely identify the server or node that generated the ID, ensuring that multiple nodes can generate IDs independently without collisions.
   
3. **Sequence number**: The remaining part of the ID is a sequence number, which is incremented for each ID generated on a given node. This ensures that multiple IDs can be generated within the same millisecond without collisions.

### Breakdown of Flickr’s 64-bit ID structure:

- **Timestamp (41 bits)**: This represents the time in milliseconds since a custom epoch. The time is stored as a 41-bit number, which gives a very large range for the timestamp. This means IDs will stay unique for many years.
  
- **Node identifier (10 bits)**: This part represents the node or machine that generated the ID. If there are 1024 nodes, 10 bits can accommodate all possible nodes.
  
- **Sequence number (12 bits)**: A 12-bit counter is used to ensure uniqueness when multiple IDs are generated within the same millisecond.

### Structure of the ID

```text
+------------+--------------+---------------------+
| Timestamp  | Node ID      | Sequence Number     |
+------------+--------------+---------------------+
| 41 bits    | 10 bits      | 12 bits             |
+------------+--------------+---------------------+
```

### How does it work in practice?

- The **timestamp** is the most significant part of the ID and ensures that IDs are ordered by time. When two nodes are generating IDs at the same time, the **sequence number** ensures that the IDs remain unique even if they are generated in the same millisecond.
- The **node ID** part allows for ID generation on multiple machines (nodes) without collisions, and it prevents the need for coordination between different nodes. Each node has a unique identifier that is part of the ID.
- The **sequence number** starts at `0` for each millisecond and is incremented with each new ID generated. If a node generates more than one ID per millisecond, the sequence number ensures that these IDs are unique even if they are generated at the same time.

### ID Generation Example (in Java):

Here is a simplified implementation of Flickr’s ID generation method, using a similar approach with a 64-bit ID structure. We’ll use the current time (in milliseconds), a node identifier, and a sequence number to create unique IDs.
e Code:

- **`CUSTOM_EPOCH`**: A custom epoch timestamp (2010-01-01 00:00:00 in this case) is used as the reference point for generating the timestamp.
  
- **`nodeId`**: A unique identifier for the node (server) generating the ID. This can be any number, but it should be unique across nodes. Here, we use 10 bits to accommodate up to 1024 nodes.

- **`sequence`**: A counter that increments for each ID generated in the same millisecond. If the counter exceeds the maximum value for the sequence, it waits for the next millisecond.

- **`generateId()`**: This method generates the ID by combining the timestamp, node ID, and sequence number. It ensures that IDs are unique even if generated within the same millisecond by incrementing the sequence number. If the sequence overflows, it waits for the next millisecond to generate a new ID.

- **`waitForNextMillis()`**: This method ensures that the generator waits until the next millisecond if the sequence number overflows.

### Output Example:

```
Generated ID: 380024297547288064
Generated ID: 380024297547288065
Generated ID: 380024297547288066
Generated ID: 380024297547288067
Generated ID: 380024297547288068
Generated ID: 380024297547288069
Generated ID: 380024297547288070
Generated ID: 380024297547288071
Generated ID: 380024297547288072
Generated ID: 380024297547288073
```

### Conclusion:

This implementation follows Flickr's ID generation strategy with some simplifications. It generates globally unique IDs that are time-ordered and can scale across multiple nodes. This method ensures that IDs are unique, even when multiple nodes are generating IDs concurrently, and it also ensures that IDs are ordered by time. This approach is highly useful for distributed systems that require globally unique identifiers without requiring complex coordination mechanisms.
